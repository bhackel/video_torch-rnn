Code used to create the video: https://github.com/bhackel/video_torch-rnn
Long Sample: https://github.com/bhackel/video_torch-rnn/blob/master/MYSTUFF/video/long_sample.txt
I used pyside2 and ffmpeg PFPFPHAHAHA to make the video.
The graph and samples in the video are not really synchronized, so it's weird at the start. Also the format is cluttered. 5/10

The model used was torch-rnn by Justin Johnson, https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn. I did not write a single line of machine learning code for this video.
The dataset is one large text file consisting of every English-translated volume of the light novel series "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru." I compiled it together from the EPUBs using an online tool.

The background music is ✨ramune✨ by ✨ujbeats✨.
